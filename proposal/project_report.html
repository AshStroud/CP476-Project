<li><p>Client side component &amp; UI</p>
<p>The client user interface includes the ability to provide your name, start the game, and start a new game.</p>
<p>In the actual game itself, the user can interact with an 8 x 8 grid of buttons. Both by right and left clicking. Left clicking checks to see if there is a bomb in that button. If there is, the user is told that the game is over. If there isn’t, the user is told how many bombs are in proximity to that button.</p>

<li><p>Server side CGI components</p>
<p>The server side creates the puzzle for the user and keeps track of their username and games played through the mongoDB. Connection with the server happens when the client UI is started. There are multiple messages sent and from the server: a. Name: The client sends the username to check if the username exists. We go into more detail below. b. Mines: The server sends back mines randomly spread through the board. This is done server side to avoid too much heavy processing on the client side. c. New Game: Tells the server that the user has started a new game. The server increments the amount of games played by 1 in the mongodb.</p>

<li><p>Database tier design, data, usage The database holds list of all the users it has seen and the amount of games they have played.</p>
<p><img src="images/mongoDB.png" width="400" /></p>
<p>When the user submits their name, it is sent to the server. The server checks to see if the username exists. If the username exists, it returns the username and the number of times they played the game to the client. If the username does not exist, it inserts the username and 0 into the database and returns it to the client as well.</p>
<p>The client then displays the amount of games played to the user. Everytime the user plays a new game, the server increments the amount by one in the database.</p>

<li><p>New features and tools</p>
<p>The minesweeper game now relies on a websocket server to function. The server now allows for multiple connections from different users. The game also has a mongodb database to keep track of users and the amount of games they have played. Using react to render different components inside other components. Rather than than just having everything essentially static with in the html. This allows for easier changes and creates a dynamic user interface.</p>

<li>Problem solving algorithms
<ol class="incremental" type="a">
<li>The major computing problem that we solved for our project is the ability for a user to connect to the server of our Minesweeper application, in order to set up and play the game and have their username and number of plays tracked in our database. We solved for the ability for the client and server to connect with one another - the client will create the Minesweeper board and its cells (both are rendered as separate React components), but the server is responsible for determining the location of the mines. We solved for the ability for the client and server to pass this information to one another as needed.</li>
<li>Finally, we solved for the ability to use a MongoDB database to display information on the client-side. We solved for the ability for the server to communicate with the MongoDB database based on information passed from the client to the server, and for the server to pass MongoDB database information to the client in order to render how many times the user has played already, add their nickname to the database if it does not already exist, and increment the count of how many times they have played the game if their nickname already exists in the database.</li>
<li>Our data collection requirements will include collecting a user’s nickname, which they set for themselves before starting the game. We use this information to display to the user how many times they have played the game previously, depending on whether or not their nickname already exists in our database. We will also collect data regarding game status (whether a game is completed or not) in order to display winning and losing messsages to the users. Additonally, we use ReactJS in order to represent our Minesweeper board data to the user.</li>
<li>To solve the computing problem of creating a Minesweeper game with a randomized board for each playthrough, one of the key algorithms we need is an algorithm to create and randomize the Minesweeper board for the player. The algorithm that the server uses to achieve this focuses on randomizing the location of the mines - we start by creating a 2D array that essentially represents the square Minesweeper board, which is 8x8. We also keep track of the number of mines that have currently been planted on the board - the maximum number of mines that can be planted is 10. While we have not yet planted 10 mines on our “board” (in our 2D-array), we select a random number between 0 and 8 twice to represent the x and y-coordinate. If there is no mine at this coordinate, a mine is planted there, and we increment the number of mines that have currently been planted by 1. Once this algorithm has been run, the 2D-array is passed to client, wihch is then used by the Board component to render the board for the user. By generating random Minesweeper boards, we can ensure that the players are not playing the same Minesweeper board multiple times. Below is a screenshot of our mine randomization algorithm:</li>

<li><p>Efficiency and robustness</p>
<ol class="incremental" type="a">
<li>To keep the program light weight and efficient, we used react to compartmentalize our program. That way when a change is needed to be made to the HTML we did not need to reload the entire webpage but only the small component of it.</li>
<li>We also gained effiency by using the jquery functionality. It is able to simplify the programs DOM traversal in communications between the client and server. Otherwise this would be a bulky process that takes up large amounts of processing time.</li>
